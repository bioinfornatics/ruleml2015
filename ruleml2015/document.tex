\begin{abstract}
Today's functional genomic knowledge is built from an incredible amount of genomes, whereas curation efforts to annotate them tend to decrease despite some community initiatives \cite{mazumder2010community}. Bio-annotator community faced to big data issue need to be assisted to providing expert annotation as gold standard.
To ease this manual process, we developed a Genomic Rule Oriented Object Logic System named GROOLS. It reconstruct metabolite networks from both automatic tasks and expert manual curating to provide a global view of predicted functions to bio-annotator. Thus, the community can to use the network context to annotate missing proteins. 
The combined use of a modern paradigm as an oriented object programming with the logic fields provide an interesting space of research. Complex biological information are pulled from various resources and represented as a structured object. These objects are bivalent, for a computer specialist, is an instance of a defined class, while for a logician is a theory.
Business rule coerce, control and make business decision. It separates clearly business logic from business application. A Business Rule Management System (BRMS) evaluates facts against a set of rules in a reproducible and efficient way.
This paper shows a standardized way to analyze and annotate genomes using a relevance logic and a hierarchical knowledge representation.

\section{General description}
GROOLS is an applied research project mixing  biology, informatics and logic. It aim to standardize the use of biological results to annotate a genome. Highlighting bio-annotator on expected and unexpected gene annotation. Mining complex biological information to discovery new knowledge.\\
During analysis of a newly sequenced genome, the bio-annotator is facing the difficult task of checking the annotation consistency. Therefore, in such cases the bio-annotator should check the proteome against the biological knowledge about the organisms under study. However this is a colossal task and bio- annotator usually check sequence similarity to an already annotated protein to infer the gene annotation. The early stages are to understand the bio-annotator reasoning and the identification of a generic model. This generic model will be based on a predefined vocabulary.\\
A bio-annotator uses at least three kinds of facts. The first type is a ``prediction fact'', found by bioinformatics computing or bio-annotator analysis. The second one is an ``assertion fact'', an empirical evidence on organisms. The thirds is a trusted knowledge, a knowledge known to occur on one ore more organisms. A bio-annotator studying tryptophan autotroph organism,  will expect to found tryptophan bio-synthesis pathway. The corresponding knowledge will therefore be marked accordingly as required. Reciprocally, if it is widely known to not grow on tryptophan free media which leads to the avoidance of the tryptoptan bio-synthesis pathway. \\
Such reasoning system need a generic representation of the biological knowledge to be used on an automatic genomic annotation. The BRMS used need to handle more than simple text message. Indeed biological data are complex and structured with some relation as ``is-a'' and ``has-a''. It need to understand and reason such relation. \\
In order to have this kind of reasoning, we need to select resources, where facts come from. An asserted fact can come from biolog data \cite{biolog}, a trusted knowledge from unipathway \cite{morgat2011unipathway} and prediction from bioinformatics results or bio-annotator expertise from the Prokaryotic Genome DataBase (PkGDB) \cite{vallenet2012microscope} \\
Trusted knowledge are gathered to form a graph. Prediction will influence the leaf of the graph while assertion influence the roots of the graph. The prediction influences are spread from the leaf to the roots. Assertions and predictions facts can to take four kind of values. An assertion can take one of these vocabulary:  present, absent, both or unknown. While a prediction is assigned to one of these vocabularies: required, avoided, both or unknown. These states are inferred to a knowledge giving ability to get a precise ending. This aims to help bio-annotator to focus on missing gene annotations using from a sequenced genome a restructuration of the metabolic network \cite{francke2005reconstructing}.\\
This kind of logic is described by Belnap \cite{belnap1977useful} as a four valued logic. These theories are connected via some defined interface vocabularies. For each genome a set of rules is apply on a huge amount of biological knowledge to notify completeness and consistency. To achieve this we have applied the Object-Oriented First Order Logic (OOFOL) \cite{amir1999object} and extend it to a four valued logic. The four valued logic gives a finer analysis than the classic First Order Logic. Indeed, with the classic FOL, a non-observation is the same thing as non-existence.  This being so, biological point of view a false knowledge do not means the same thing than a not observed knowledge. In GROOLS, knowledge objects are theories which takes the form of a directed acyclic graph. Both ``assertion'' and ``prediction'' fact are an extension of a fact. They describe what is predicted or observed by experimentation.

\section{Genomic annotation}

Genomic annotation is one of most important task, once done we will be able to know organisms molecular physiology, increasing our understanding of biological processes. This field aims to understand what an organisms is able to do from DNA sequence. The genome annotation unit process is the product of gene (protein). Understanding its function can lead to new discoveries. Some of these proteins are defined as enzymes, which means that they are able to catalyze at least one chemical reaction. The enzymatic product of theses chemicals reactions will be used by an enzyme, which by doing so gives some new products. This enzyme chained process is described by a metabolic pathway (Figure~\ref{fig:pathway}). To form a metabolic network, an enzyme can be depicted in more than one metabolic pathway.

    \label{fig:pathway}
\end{figure}

A bio-annotator to annotate usually do several steps. Commonly he defines a coding region, get corresponding sequence, search an homologous sequence and take a look to the genomic context to infer an annotation. In our opinion, genome annotation task is more productive to be done after an automatic genomic annotation. Hence, it allows the reconstruction of metabolic process (see \cite{francke2005reconstructing}), which is filled by automatics tasks, and helps the bio-annotator to focus on missing genes. This automatics gene annotation can be displayed with some other informations,
enabling a better understanding of the organism abilities (depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:metabolicNetworkReconstruction}). A first approach leads to the conclusion that the Pathway X is not present. However if the studied organism is known to have the pathway X as described by some experimental information. Bio-annotator point of view the pathway X is certainly present as a specific reaction occuring in the pathway X. Indeed biological knowledge has some hole. Some enzymatic reaction are known to occur into an  organisms but these proteins are bound to any genes, uwhich is usually described as an orphan enzyme \cite{sorokina2014profiling}. This alternative reasoning is optimistic and fits better with our incomplete knowledge also known as pathway hole.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics{img/pathway.pdf}
    \caption{Guided metabolic network reconstruction. A red backgrounds means a knowledge is not present. A light blue color means a present knowledge. }
    \label{fig:metabolicNetworkReconstruction}
\end{figure}

This kind of reasoning should to be done using up to twelve thousand genes by organisms \cite{dagan2013genomes}. Moreover with the emergence of next sequencing generation, genome sequencing provides DNA sequence in a shorter time frame quickly than bio-annotator community can do. On the other hand human expertise can lead to some inconsistencies which will be reused by others bio-annotator. To avoid these issues we develop an expert system to automatize the bio-annotator reasoning. An automated reasoner can manage billions of facts in a standard and reproducible way.

\section{Benefits of applying an oriented-object expert system}
Biological facts are stored into many bio-data warehouse, which are typed to their corresponding characteristic to finally reason over. For a computer scientist such information fits an oriented object approach. An oriented object programming can to represent complex data by the use of classes and ease of handling. Each kind of data corresponds to a class. With the use of an object relational mapping, objects are automatically pulled to a typed information from a data warehouse. An object is an instance of the corresponding class. A computer scientist will apply a formula, an algorithm, a reasoning, depending on the current used information type. \\
We do not know in advance which type of object the end user will provides. In order to communicate between these different type of objects, the vocabulary is described by the use of interface. An interface provides a low coupling to have a well-structured computer system. Interfaces imposes communication protocols by defining a vocabulary. A class which implement an interface need to implements all vocabularies defined in the interface. In other hand interface avoid multi-inheritance issues. To this end the set of rules use the interfaces to provides a standardized vocabulary through any type of object. Following the lowerCamelCase convention syntax (i.e getX, setX \dots), the use of inheritance interfaces define the commons accessors and mutators. Thus attributes names are extractable in a standard way from various objects. We describe three generics type of facts: Knowledge, Prediction and Assertion (Figure~\ref{fig:fact}) .

JBoss DROOLS is an open rule-engine written in java \cite{proctor2008drools}. Natively an oriented-object language using a PHREAK algorithm \cite{phreak} to reason over a structured data. It does a nice bridge between our java application and the logic paradigm.

\subsection{Reasoning over structured data}
Logic point of view a class is a structure. An instance of a class ( an object ) is a theory. An object can to contains other objects, that means a theory is a graph of smaller theories. Each theory are defined by a coherent set of values. A class C is a tuple \( \langle \mathcal{L}_{C}, \mathcal{A}_{C} , \mathcal{I}_{C} \rangle \). Where  \(\mathcal{L} \) is the vocabulary (class methods) ,  \(\mathcal{A} \)  a set of axioms (attributes) and \(\mathcal{I} \) a set of vocabulary to implement (\( \mathcal{I}_{C} \subset\mathcal{L}_{C} \)). The truth of a sub-theory can be inferred to those upper theory following a Belnap logic. This logic is designed to cope with various and contradicory information sources. Such that if all sub-theory are true then upper theories are true. if all sub-theory are false then upper theories are false. If a set of sub-theory are true and another false then upper-theory take the value ``both''. And also if any information match a theory then the theory take the state ``neither'' (see Table~\ref{table:belnap}). In such case a ``and'' node have the following priority evaluation: false > both > none > true. As an example, a sub-theory S from a theory  T representing a  ``and'' node. S is false then upper theory T is put to false. To the same line, priority evaluation for ``or'' node is: true > none > both > false.

        \end{tabular}
    \end{minipage}
\end{table}


From the bio-annotator Point of view, there is some cases not as well covered by this logic. Indeed, if a required and not observed pathway X has at least one specific reaction (not shared to another reactions blocks). The reaction block corresponding to this reaction can be considered as observed in the pathway X. Then the corresponding reaction block is set to present which infer the presence to the pathway X. In this cases, we know the studied organisms has the required ability. Our knowledge is incomplete, with an optimistic Belnap's logic, a non observed pathway become observed. To do this, the ``and'' node priority evaluation has been modified  to true > false > both > none.

\subsection{Hierarchical knowledge representation}
A pathway can be represented  as a directed acyclic graph. In the following manner, a pathway contains one or more pathway variant. A pathway variant contains one or more reaction blocks. And a reaction block contains one or more enzymatic reactions, these enzymatic reactions appear in one or more reaction blocks (as the reaction 3 in Figure~\ref{fig:metabolicNetworkReconstruction}). These knowledge need to be studied, to know if their presence or absence in the given organism. Prediction fact will infer in a bottom-up way while assertion fact will do it in a top-down way. Once all facts are spreads over the DAG of knowledge a refined conclusion is put on each knowledge. This conclusion will be opposed to an assertion fact with a prediction fact comparing a four valued logic to an another following the conclusion table~\ref{table:conclusion}.

\section{Conclusion and future work}

Our genomic annotation reasoner provides an efficient and standardized way to reconstructing metabolic network. On each organisms, billions known proteins infer their functions to the corresponding gene. Bio-Annotator can focus their expertize on a smaller set of genes. Inconsistencies are detected and raised automatically to the bio-annotator to stop the spread of erroneous gene annotations. Using metabolic network reconstruction data are visualizable in a biological sense. Each knowledge (node of the network) has a refined conclusion.\\
To workaround knowledge hole we will focus our work on filling more accurate and relevant genome annotations.Thanks to months of support of the Grools systems meet complex demands of the bio-annotator community.
